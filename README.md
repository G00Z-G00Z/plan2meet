# Plan 2 Meet

This is a project that will improve some when2meet.com's functionality. 

## ‚ö°Problem

The webpage [when2meet.com](http://when2meet.com) is a great page for planning meeting in a quicker and more ascessible way. I love using this page whenever I‚Äôve a team project. However, I believe that the page is outdated, and has so much potential to improve. So, using when2meet.com as an inspiration I want to improve it‚Äôs functionality and add new features.

## ‚úÖ Solution

I want to add new features and handdle the process of planning a meeting in a different way, without lossing the main goal of the page. I‚Äôd like to: 

- [ ]  Make it prettier and mobile friendly, with a UI library
- [ ]  Make it a PWA
- [ ]  Make accounts, using google, to link events to google calendar
- [ ]  Make steps to create and event, adding a new step for actually creating the event on the calendar (either in the app or in googgle calendar)
- [ ]  Make sharing the app, both the event and the app itself easier, by manking QR codes and sharing buttons
- [ ]  Make making the event update the master calendar in real time

## ‚ùìDefine the Why

Because I‚Äôm a planner, I love apps like when2meet.com, however I have 2 main problems with the current state of the app: 

- Personally, I think is outdated, so I always end up making the events in google calendar after setting a date. So I‚Äôd like if that process would be integrated in the app itself.
- I think most of the people do not have the habit of planning stuff out, so I‚Äôd want to change that by making the app easier to use, and visually appealing to encourage them to plan ahead.
- I love taking courses online to learn about tech, so this project is perfect for practicing many of the things I've learned. 

## üëÆ Alternatives/Current State of the Market

The inspiration, which is the current state, is [when2meet.com](http://when2meet.com). Although this app and when2meet.com are very similar and accomplish virtually the same goal, I think that when2meet.com has these problems: 

1. Its UI is outdated, so newcomers that can have a hard time sticking to the app
2. It doesn‚Äôt have any way of scheduling the event after all the votes are submitted. I‚Äôd be amaizing if after a click of the button, everyone would get a google calendar meeting created for them, or  notification within the app itself. 
3. The data, is not real-time, so you have to reload the page whenever you want to see other‚Äôs data. I picture the app being used in real time, so I think it would be a nicer touch if the app is real time.

## üåüValue-Props/USPs of your solution

- [ ]  Make it prettier and mobile friendly, with a UI library
- [ ]  Make it a PWA
- [ ]  Make accounts, using google, to link events to google calendar
- [ ]  Make steps to create and event, adding a new step for actually creating the event on the calendar (either in the app or in googgle calendar)
- [ ]  Make sharing the app, both the event and the app itself easier, by manking QR codes and sharing buttons
- [ ]  Make making the event update the master calendar in real time

## üíªWhat does the MVP look like?

- [ ]  The MVP successfully creates an event
- [ ]  It shows where the most people match in the calendar in real time
- [ ]  It uses UI libraries to make it more modern

After completing these objectives: 

- [ ]  It shares and event using QR code and has share buttons for social media
- [ ]  It schedules the meeting in google calendar
- [ ]  It sends notifications to the user

## ‚åõMilestones and Timelines

- Create and event
- Handle showing matching dates
- Logging in with google
- Sharing the event through QR and social media buttons
- Publishing the event in google calendar
- Sending notifications to the user (optional)

# For developers

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
